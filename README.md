`simpledroid` provides a way to output a simplified DROID signature file. It is
based on my work on [wd-droidy][wddroidy-1].

## Why?

Simply completing the circle on the simplified DROID work. The mechanism reduces
the barriers to entry for writing signature files for DROID opening up new
opportunities for testing and customization. It also makes future PRONOM
development effort easier by reducing the barriers needed to output a compatible
signature file.

## Reference file

There is a reference signature file in the [reference][ref-1] folder.

## More information

More information will appear here in the fullness of time. Take a look at
wd-droidy for more info and let me know if you make use of any of this work.
